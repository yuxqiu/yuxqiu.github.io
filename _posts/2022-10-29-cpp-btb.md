### What is an abstract machine

> **Abstract machines provide an intermediate language stage for compilation. They bridge the gap between the high level of a programming language and the low level of a real machine.** The instructions of an abstract machine are tailored to the particular operations required to implement operations of a specific source language or class of lanquages."
>
> Stephan Diehl, Pieter Hartel, Peter Sestoft Future Generation Computer Systems 16 2000)

> "Programming language specifications (not just C and C++, all high-level programming language specifications), **define the languages in terms of an abstract machine, which, in this usage, is the simplest imaginary computer capable of executing a program in the source language** (or a family of languages, as in the case of the JVM)." (my emphasis)

### C++ Abstract Machines

> "The C++ abstract machine is a portable abstraction of your operating system, kernel and hardware. The abstract machine is the intermediary between your C++ program and the system that it is run on."
>
> Bryce Adelstein Lelbach, Core C++ 2019, The C++ Execution Model


### Rationale

We want abstraction to hide the complexity of different platforms.


### The Programmer's Concern

Key takeaway: when we are writing C++ code, we are writing to the C++ Abstract Machine


### Key aspects of C++ Abstract Machine

> The semantic descriptions in this document define a **parameterized** **nondeterministic** **abstract machine**. This document places no requirement on the structure of conforming **implementations**. In particular, they need not copy or emulate the structure of the abstract machine. Rather, conforming implementations are required to emulate (only) the **observable behavior** of the abstract machine as explained below.

### Well-Formed, ill-formed, and IFNDR Program

> \[defns.well.formed\](3.32) C++ program constructed according to the syntax rules, diagnosable semantic rules, and the one-definition rule

> for a well-formed program construct and correct data, that depends on the implementation and that each implementation documents

> for a well-formed program construct and correct data, that depends on the implementation
- Each unspecified behavior yields one result from the set of all possible valid results
- This is the nondeterminism aspect of the abstract machine
- eg
	- the evaluation order of arguments
	- how to store identical string literals

> ill-formed program is not well-formed. ie. has syntax errors or diagnosable semantic errors

> IFNDR (ill-formed, no diagnostic required) program is a program that has non-diagnosable semantic error


### Structure of C++ Abstract Machine

![](/assets/img/blog/2022/10/1667136579085.png)

#### Memory
- Memory is a single flat space
- All parts of memory are equally reachable by the abstract machine
- There is no memory hierarchy
	- No concept of stack, registers, or cache (Although stack unwinding is mentioned several times)
	- No concept of heterogeneous memory (e.g., GPUs, co-processors)
- Access to memory has uniform latency
- Memory is composed of bytes
	- The standard specifies the minimum requirements for what a byte is in terms of what it must be able to represent
- The memory available to a program consists of one or more sequences of contiguous bytes
	- Any operation in a program can potentially access any memory location in those sequences of bytes
- Every byte has a unique location in memory - its address
	- Addresses are represented in our program by pointers


#### Objects
- Operations in a program create, destroy, refer to, access, and manipulate objects, which have
	- size
	- alignment
	- storage duration
	- lifetime
	- type
	- value
	- name (optional)
- An object may have at most one memory location
- An implementation is allowed to store two objects at the same address, or not store an object at all, if the program cannot observe the difference (the as-if rule at work!)

#### Expressions
- Every C++ expression has an associated type
- Every C++ expression is a member of a value category

#### Threads
- What does it mean to invoke and execute a function?
	- Functions consist of statements
	- Statements consist of expressions
- An expression is a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a computation
	- To perform that computation, the expression must be evaluated
	- Evaluating an expression can result in a value and can cause side effects
- Evaluating an expressions that causes side effects results in changes to the program's execution state, and possibly to observable behavior
- The C++ standard rules governing the evaluation of expression are formulated in terms of an expression's type and value category

## BTB: structure of program

### Translational Units and Phrase of Translation
1. A translation unit is defined (roughly) as
	1. A source file,
	2. Plus with all the headers and source files included via the #include directive,
	3. Minus any source lines skipped by conditional inclusion preprocessing directives (#ifdef),
	4. And all macros expanded
2. 9 phrases
	5. Preprocessing (Phrase 1 - 6) (page.22 - 27)
		1. The output is the so-called translational unit
	6. Compilation: syntax analysis, semantic analysis, codegen (Phrase 7 - 8)
		1. The output is the translated translational unit
	7. Linking: image creation

### Declaration and Definition

1. Entity (These rules are about Entity)
2. Name of the entity
	1. What surprises me is that: variable inside functions are declaration; this conforms to our big pictures in (3): the set of definition is a subset of declaration.
3. Declaration
	1. Name of the entity is introduced by declaration
4. Definition
	1. Every declaration is also a definition except ...

### Linkage

0. If names are these types of things ..., then it may have linkage
1. External Linkage: can be used by other translational unit
2. Internal Linkage: can be used inside the entire translational unit
3. No Linkage: can only be used within the scope it's declared


### ODR

1. A given translational unit can contain at most one definition of any ...
2. A given program must contain exactly one definition of every non-inline variable or function that is used in the program
	- multiple declarations are OK, but only one definition

For an inline variable or an inline function, a definition is required in every translation unit that uses it
- inline was originally a suggested optimization made to the compiler
- It has now evolved to mean "multiple definitions are permitted"
- So, `inline` doesn't necessarily make compiler create inline functions, but can also issue weak symbol that lets linker to choose one definition when linking

### ABI

ABI (application binary interface) is the platform-specific specification of how entities defined in one TU interact with entities defined in another TU
- Compilers and Linkers must agree on the same ABI

For C++, this includes things like
- Name mangling for functions
- Name mangling for non-template types
- Name mangling for template instantiations
- The size, layout, and alignment of objects of any given type
- How the bytes in an object's binary representation are interpreted
- Calling conventions for passing arguments to functions and receiving a returned object
- Calling conventions for making system calls

On Linux, GCC and Clang use the Itanium ABI; On Windows, MSVC uses its own ABI

### Name Mangling

The C language does not provide overloading or namespaces
- Given a C function whose declaration is void fubar (int),
- The corresponding symbol name in object code is fubar
- The symbol name will be the same no matter the number of parameters or their types
