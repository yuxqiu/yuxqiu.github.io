I will elaborate a bit on why ElGamal public key encryption can be thought of as approximately equivalent to using an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchanged key as a one-time pad.

## Prerequisite

### Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Exchange

1. Let $$G$$ be a cyclic group of prime order $$q$$ with generator $$g$$.
2. **Party A**:
   - Picks a secret key $$a \in \mathbb{Z}_q$$.
   - Computes the public key: $$\textcolor{teal}{pk_A} = g^a$$.
3. **Party B**:
   - Picks a secret key $$b \in \mathbb{Z}_q$$.
   - Computes the public key: $$\textcolor{orange}{pk_B} = g^b$$.
4. Both parties compute the shared key:
   - A computes: $$(pk_B)^a = g^{ba}$$.
   - B computes: $$(pk_A)^b = g^{ab}$$.

Both parties arrive at the same shared secret $$\textcolor{#8B4513}{g^{ab}}$$, which can be used for symmetric encryption.

See also: [Ephemeral and/or static keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange#Ephemeral_and/or_static_keys).

## Original ElGamal Encryption

Let's first recall the original ElGamal Encryption. Let $$G$$ be a cyclic group of prime order $$q$$ with generator $$g$$. An ElGamal Encryption is a tuple of 3 PPT algorithms:

1. **KeyGen**:
   - Choose a random secret key $$sk \in \mathbb{Z}_q$$.
   - Compute the public key $$pk = g^{sk}$$.
   - Output: $$(pk, sk)$$.

2. **Encrypt(pk, m)**:
   - Choose a random $$r \in \mathbb{Z}_q$$.
   - Compute $$c_1 = g^r$$.
   - Compute $$c_2 = m \cdot pk^r = m \cdot g^{r \cdot sk}$$.
   - Output: ciphertext $$c = (c_1, c_2)$$.

3. **Decrypt(sk, c)**:
   - Parse ciphertext $$c = (c_1, c_2)$$.
   - Compute shared secret $$s = c_1^{sk} = g^{r \cdot sk}$$.
   - Recover message: $$m = c_2 \cdot s^{-1}$$.

{: .block-tip }

Suppose A wants to send a message to B and knows B's ElGamal public key. In this scenario:

- B's public key in ElGamal encryption is essentially a static DH key, written as $$\textcolor{orange}{g^{sk_B}}$$.
- When A encrypts a message using B's public key, it effectively performs a DH key exchange:
  - A picks a random $$r$$ and computes $$\textcolor{teal}{g^r}$$, an ephemeral DH key.
  - A then computes a shared key $$\textcolor{#8B4513}{g^{r \cdot sk_B}}$$ and uses it to blind the message $$m$$.

- It's not a pure One-Time Pad (OTP) because the encryption uses multiplication rather than XOR[^3].

[^3]: [Hashed ElGamal](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/1568) emulates OTP by hashing the shared key $$p = H(pk^r)$$ and XORing it with the message. This avoids encoding/decoding messages into the group used by ElGamal.
