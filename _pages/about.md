I am an MEng Computer Science student at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and was a B.S. CS exchange student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). My research interests are in applied cryptography, system and security. Specifically, I am interested in studying how to build secure systems (blockchain, ML, ...) by improving and designing cryptographic primitives.

In addition, I enjoy reading books (fiction, essays, poetry, travel literature, sociology, and basically anything I find interesting), watching movies/TV shows (romances, thrillers, documentaries, dramas, animations), traveling and tinkering (contributing to open source projects, fixing some random Linux problems, etc.).

**I am currently looking for PhD positions!**
