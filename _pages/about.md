I am a MEng Computer Science student at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). My research interests include systems and security.

Specifically, I am deeply interested in studying how systems work from the bottom up, and how secure systems can be constructed for the benefit of all.

In addition to my interest in computer science, I enjoy reading books (fiction, essays, poetry, travel literature, sociology, and basically anything I find interesting), watching movies/TV shows (romances, thrillers, documentaries, dramas, animations), and travelling (13/195 countries in the world, 14/50 states in the US, 16/34 provinces in China).
