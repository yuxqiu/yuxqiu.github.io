Hi! I am a recent MEng CS graduate at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and was a B.S. CS exchange student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). My research interests are in applied cryptography, system and security.

In my free time, I enjoy reading [books](/witsky), watching movies, tinkering with some [open source projects](https://github.com/yuxqiu), and most importantly, [traveling](/traveling).
